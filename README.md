## Project Title:
<u>Car Rental System:</u> An admin exists whose responsibility is to update the registrations and update the rents and returns. In this rental a Customer who has been registered in the database can rent a car for any no. of days they want for a certain amount of fee. Cars are also registered in the database by the admin based on their make, model, and availability. Whenever a car has been rented by a customer, its availability status changes from “Yes” to “No” and a due date (date on which car will supposedly be returned) is provided. Customer details include name, address, customer id, phone no. and age. <p>Should the person fail to return the car before or on the due date, they will be charged with a fine. For each day the customer is unable to return the car, they will be fined Rs. 100. A log has also been created for the car registration so that whatever changes are made to the car registration, they are shown in the logs and it also shows the date at which the changes were made so as to make it more secure. The car id for the car and the customer id for the customer are unique so that they can be recognized easily. </p>
